							<h1>Algorithmic Redistricting using MCMC Methods</h1>
							<p>In the Information Age, political polarization has reached levels unprecedented in American history.
								We present a redistricting algorithm powered by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to provide an unbiased
								and transparent way to represent voters.

						<h2>What Is Redistricting?</h2>
						<p>Redistricting is the process of drawing electoral district boundaries under specific state-mandated guildelines.
							This occurs around every ten years with the census collection, but may occur more frequently.

								<h3>Necessity for Redistricting Algorithms</h3>
								<p>There are many current cases where human bias affects the legitimacy of redistricting plans, especially concerning gerrymandering. In 
									Alabama, there was a case in 2022 where the proposed district map infringed on the Voters Rights Act, as while Alabama has a 27% black population, 
									only 1 of 7 proposed districts would be majority-Black.
								</p>

								<h3>The Efficiency Gap</h3>
								<p>The efficiency gap is a useful metric for "quantifying" fairness. If we consider wasted votes being votes for the winner in excess and
									unused votes for the losing candidate, we can generate an equation to determine the efficiency of a district's votes. If we take (wasted votes for the loser) 
									- (wasted votes for the winner) and divide by total votes, we can generate a value to determine the competitiveness of a district.

							<h2>Our Methods</h2>

							<h3>Data Collection</h3>
							<p>For each county in Colorado, we need to find data on the following attributes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Contiguity</li>
								<li>Population</li>
								<li>Partisan Lean (PVI)</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>What is PVI?</h3>
							<p>
								PVI is a quantitative metric used for determining how biased a political region
								(e.g., state, county, or congressional district) is either for the Democrats or the
								Republicans. Alternatively, it represents how a political region votes relative to the
								national popular vote.
							</p>
							
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/wisconsin_pvi.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								Consider the following example for the 2020 US Presidential Election in Wisconsin. That
								year, Biden won the popular vote by 4.5% (D+4.5). However, he only won the state of
								Wisconsin by roughly 0.7% (D+0.7). Consequently, Wisconsin voted 3.8% more Republican
								than the national popular vote (or the nation at-large), and so we can estimate its PVI
								to be R+3.8.
							</p>
							
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ohio_registration.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								We chose to use PVI as a metric compared to voter registration numbers, as politically
								unaffiliated voters can still vote (and massively influence!) in elections. In October
								2021, nearly 78% of voters were unaffiliated, with slightly more registered Democrats
								than registered Republicans. However, Donald Trump won the state by roughly 8% (R+8),
								despite the Democrats' voter registration advantage. 

							</p>

							<h3>Scraping Data</h3>
							
							<p>
								For our algorithm, we found credible sources backed up with US Census data, and scraped
								the data with Python's BeautifulSoup library. All code and sources can be found on our
								detailed report and the project repository.
							</p>

							<h3>Data Processing Results</h3>
							
							<p>
								After additional processing with the Pandas library, we extracted two key CSVs from the
								US Census data. Firstly, we extracted a table that stores all pairs of contiguous counties
								in Colorado. Then, we extracted a table that stores the population and PVI for each
								Colorado county.
