						<h2>What Is Redistricting?</h2>
						<p>Redistricting is the process of drawing electoral district boundaries under specific state-mandated guildelines.
							This occurs around every ten years with the census collection, but may occur more frequently.

								<h3>Necessity for Redistricting Algorithms</h3>
								<p>There are many current cases where human bias affects the legitimacy of redistricting plans, especially concerning gerrymandering. In 
									Alabama, there was a case in 2022 where the proposed district map infringed on the Voters Rights Act, as while Alabama has a 27% black population, 
									only 1 of 7 proposed districts would be majority-Black. We also see cases such as in Wisconsin, where in 2022 Wisconsin voters elected
									all Democratic party members in elections unaffected by gerrymandering (using statewide vote), but having a 64-35 Republican lead on a district level.
									Below is a source that discusses the most gerrymandered states and gives a brief explanation as to the cause for each.

								<h3>The Efficiency Gap</h3>
								<p>The efficiency gap is a useful metric for "quantifying" fairness. If we consider wasted votes being votes for the winner in excess and
									unused votes for the losing candidate, we can generate an equation to determine the efficiency of a district's votes. If we take (wasted votes for the loser) 
									- (wasted votes for the winner) and divide by total votes, we can generate a value to determine the competitiveness of a district. Below is a source that 
									briefly explains the efficiency gap and its purpose. Essentially when calculating efficiency gap, it is important to achieve low values,
									as a proposed district plan with a high efficiency gap is considered gerrymandered.

						<h2>Data Collection</h2>
						<h3>
							For each county in Colorado, we need to find data on the following attributes:
							contiguity, population, and partisan lean (PVI).
						</h3>
								
						<div class="features">

							<section>
								<h3>What is PVI?</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/wisconsin_pvi.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									PVI is a quantitative metric used for determining how biased a political region
									(e.g., state, county, or congressional district) is either for the Democrats or the
									Republicans. Alternatively, it represents how a political region votes relative to the
									national popular vote.
								</p>

								<p>
									Consider the following example for the 2020 US Presidential Election in Wisconsin. That
									year, Biden won the popular vote by 4.5% (D+4.5). However, he only won the state of
									Wisconsin by roughly 0.7% (D+0.7). Consequently, Wisconsin voted 3.8% more Republican
									than the national popular vote (or the nation at-large), and so we can estimate its PVI
									to be R+3.8.
								</p>

							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Why not Voter Registration?</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ohio_registration.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									We chose to use PVI as a metric compared to voter registration numbers, as politically
									unaffiliated voters can still vote (and massively influence!) in elections. In October
									2021, nearly 78% of voters were unaffiliated, with slightly more registered Democrats
									than registered Republicans. However, Donald Trump won the state by roughly 8% (R+8),
									despite the Democrats' voter registration advantage.

								<h3>Scraping Data</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/us_census.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>
									For our algorithm, we found credible sources backed up with US Census data, and scraped
									the data with Python's BeautifulSoup library. All code and sources can be found on our
									detailed report and the project repository.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Data Processing Results</h3>
								
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/csv_schema.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									After additional processing with the Pandas library, we extracted two key CSVs from the
									US Census data. Firstly, we extracted a table that stores all pairs of contiguous counties
									in Colorado. Then, we extracted a table that stores the population and PVI for each
									Colorado county.

								<h3>How It Works</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Example_Graph_MCMC.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>
									<li>Think of states as graphs where the nodes are counties, edges between nodes represent counties that share a border. A district is dividing this graph into subgraphs, see above picture.</li>
                							<li>We define a score function that gives us a measure of how fair a particular district plan is.</li>
                							<li>To do algorithmic redistricting, we slowly move nodes from one subgraph to another, checking if we want to change our current district plan to the new one by seeing if it has a better “score.”</li>
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Score Functions</h3>
								
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/populationscorefunction.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									Here is the score function that we used for our model. We are summing up the squared differences of our actual district populations with an ideal district population (where every district has exactly the same populations). Our model also considered PVI, and we created a seperate score function that worked to create more competitive districts by assinging lower scores to district plans where the PVI was closer to 0 across all districts.

								<h3>What is happening in the video?</h3>
								<p>
									The graph that we start with is the current districting of Colorado. Each iteration involves randomly picking an edge that lies between two distinct subgraphs, we call these <strong>conflicted edges</strong>. Once we have a conflicted edge, we then randomly select to move one of the two nodes it connects to and move that node to the subgraph (district) of the other node. We call this the proposed state, and we accept this proposed state if it has a lower (better) score from our score function. We also accept it sometimes if it has a worse score function, because there is the possibility that it could be closely related to a graph that has an even lower score function. For the case you are seeing on the left, our score function is trying to make the districts each contain a more equal proportion of the population, while also trying to make the districts be more competitive by minimizing our PVI Score function.
								</p>
								<h3>How to Run the Notebook</h3>
								<p>
									The code on our repository starts by intializing the Colorado graph with all the required data, make sure to load the requisite files "mcmc_driver" and "generate_data" as some of the functions used in this file are housed there. The algorithm works for an arbitrary graph, as long as each node has both an attribute 'population' and an attribute 'PVI.' If you want to create a new metric that you want to optimize, just build a score function of similar structure as PVIScore and PopulationScore (remember to make smaller values correspond to more desirable district plans), add the corresponding attribute to your nodes, finally normalize the value of your new score function so that it return numbers of the same order as the other score functions and add this score function to the total score function.

						<h2>Societal Implications</h2>
						<p>Here are each of our beliefs on the societal impact of our redistricting algorithm.
						</p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<h3>Mitch</h3>
								<p>Mitch's Opinion</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>Luke</h3>
								<p>
									During the early stages of the project, when I was discussing societal questions
									with my project group, I felt that the key motive for developing an algorithmic-based
									redistricting algorithm was the lack of knowledge and trust people have for redistricting
									commissions in the present-day.<br><br>
									
									This public sentiment can be reflected and verified by recent polling. In August 2021,
									The Hill reported a poll by “the nonprofit anti-corruption group RepresentUs,” which stated
									that “[nearly] 9 in 10 voters oppose the use of redistricting in a manner that aims to help
									one political party or certain politicians win an election.” [1] So, why is there a massive
									disparity between support against gerrymandering and the gerrymandered district we see in
									our current House delegation? In my eyes, I believe that Americans are unsure what their
									alternatives for redistricting are, and if they are any better than the status quo.<br><br>
									
									This leads into one of the biggest benefits for our algorithm. It is open-source and easily
									accessible. It does not require fancy technical requirements, and can run on any
									run-of-the-mill computer. Plus, the congressional districts generated by our Markov Chain
									Monte Carlo algorithm are reproducible. It encourages people to independently evaluate
									their congressional maps.<br><br>
									
									Although different people may have different standards of fairness, the algorithm can be
									checked against the Congressional Redistricting Criteria, an official government resource
									outlining how to create ideal congressional maps. [2] For instance, a person can check if
									each political party's popular vote share matches the number of congressional districts
									won. In the 2022 House of Representatives Election in Minnesota, both parties won roughly
									50% of the popular vote and won four House seats each [3]. On the other hand, that same year 
									in Utah, the Republicans won all of the state's four House seats, despite the Democrats
									receiving roughly 33% of the statewide vote. [4] If the computer generates a map with
									districts that fail to match the statewide popular vote, they can discard the map and
									try generating a fairer one. Of course, there are other criteria people can check for,
									such as equal population, contiguity, etc.<br><br>
									
									That being said, there are valid criticisms to be made for this algorithm that can make
									people hesitant. A lack of technical knowledge behind the algorithm can make people
									skeptical, even if the algorithm produces fair congressional maps in terms of population,
									partisan lean (PVI), and other factors.<br><br>
									
									Another key criticism for our algorithm is that it does not take into account political
									trends. Take, for example, Miami-Dade county. In the 2016 US Presidential Election, the
									county voted for Hillary Clinton “by a staggering 29 percentage points in her
									presidential contest against Donald J. Trump.” Then, in the 2020 US Presidential Election,
									Biden only won Miami-Dade County by “a mere seven points,” largely due to swings in Hispanic
									voting patterns. [5]<br><br>
									
									Our algorithm can create a district that favors Democrats in 2022, but may not favor them
									in 2028, prior to the next redistricting cycle. For this reason, factoring political
									swings and trends into our model can greatly help not only the quality of the generated
									maps, but also increase public confidence in our algorithm's mission and ability to draw
									fair maps.

								<h3>Kiara</h3>
								<p>Initially, like 85% of Americans today, I was completely unaware about the effects of redistricting plans on voting outcomes [1].
									 While I had a basic understanding of gerrymandering, I was not aware of exactly how prevalent it was in society today, and I was 
									 unaware that there were so many options to solve such a perpetually contested issue. I think what really struck me while doing research 
									 on alternate redistricting algorithms was the fact that there were so many options on what it meant to create a “fair” algorithm. <br><br>

									 At first, in the early planning stages of our project, most of our group agreed that fairness should mean that the popular vote 
									 correlates with the voting outcome as closely as possible. However, as we did research there were a lot more factors to quantifying 
									 fairness than we had initially considered. Of course, one method discussed in our site is the efficiency gap, which is a measure of 
									 the percentage of votes wasted in an election [2]. Essentially, this metric is used to determine whether the number of seats won by 
									 a specific party was skewed [3]. <br><br>

									 Another metric that we encountered was the extreme outlier test, which was actually very useful for many of the papers that discussed 
									 implementing MCMC [4]. Because of the high number of simulations run by an algorithm using MCMC, it was important to create a metric to 
									 analyze the population number in each district and number of seats that would be won by each party, essentially checking for any extreme 
									 outliers and considering a redistricting that produces the mean value of all the plans to be the most optimal. While we ran multiple simulations, 
									 we selected a lambda value that would produce a redistricting plan that generally aligned with the average voting result in all of our districting plans. <br><br>

									 Finally, we also considered PVI, which mainly considers the partisanship of a proposed redistricting plan [6]. We sought to make districts more 
									 competitive, which we believed would be fair considering that many people believe that district plans that favor a particular party over another 
									 are gerrymandered. Also, one of the mains reasons we chose Colorado as our model was due to the fact that it is not considered to be gerrymandered, 
									 so a comparison between the current map and our simulated map would be more accurate in testing our algorithm, especially when considering the PVI 
									 values of our proposed redistricting to the current one. <br><br>

									 While I believe we have made a strong start with quantifying the fairness of our algorithm, I do think it is important to note that there are a lot of 
									 factors that are not considered in our data and algorithm itself. Considering the 2022 Alabama redistricting case, our algorithm does not include information 
									 on racial demographics. Especially considering that a lot of issues with districting plans involve a negative racial aspect, I think in the future it 
									 would be important to check that our algorithm is accurately representing all people, especially in states where minority voters can often get overlooked.
