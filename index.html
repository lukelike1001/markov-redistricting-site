							<h1>Algorithmic Redistricting using MCMC Methods</h1>
							<p>In the Information Age, political polarization has reached levels unprecedented in American history.
								We present a redistricting algorithm powered by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to provide an unbiased
								and transparent way to represent voters.

						<h2>What Is Redistricting?</h2>
						<p>Redistricting is the process of drawing electoral district boundaries under specific state-mandated guildelines.
							This occurs around every ten years with the census collection, but may occur more frequently.
						</p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<h3>Necessity for Redistricting Algorithms</h3>
								<p>There are many current cases where human bias affects the legitimacy of redistricting plans, especially concerning gerrymandering. In 
									Alabama, there was a case in 2022 where the proposed district map infringed on the Voters Rights Act, as while Alabama has a 27% black population, 
									only 1 of 7 proposed districts would be majority-Black.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>The Efficiency Gap</h3>
								<p>The efficiency gap is a useful metric for "quantifying" fairness. If we consider wasted votes being votes for the winner in excess and
									unused votes for the losing candidate, we can generate an equation to determine the efficiency of a district's votes. If we take (wasted votes for the loser) 
									- (wasted votes for the winner) and divide by total votes, we can generate a value to determine the competitiveness of a district.

						<h2>Data Collection</h2>
						<h3>
							For each county in Colorado, we need to find data on the following attributes:
							contiguity, population, and partisan lean (PVI).
						</h3>
								
						<div class="features">

							<section>
								<h3>What is PVI?</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/wisconsin_pvi.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									PVI is a quantitative metric used for determining how biased a political region
									(e.g., state, county, or congressional district) is either for the Democrats or the
									Republicans. Alternatively, it represents how a political region votes relative to the
									national popular vote.
								</p>

								<p>
									Consider the following example for the 2020 US Presidential Election in Wisconsin. That
									year, Biden won the popular vote by 4.5% (D+4.5). However, he only won the state of
									Wisconsin by roughly 0.7% (D+0.7). Consequently, Wisconsin voted 3.8% more Republican
									than the national popular vote (or the nation at-large), and so we can estimate its PVI
									to be R+3.8.
								</p>

							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Why not Voter Registration?</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ohio_registration.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									We chose to use PVI as a metric compared to voter registration numbers, as politically
									unaffiliated voters can still vote (and massively influence!) in elections. In October
									2021, nearly 78% of voters were unaffiliated, with slightly more registered Democrats
									than registered Republicans. However, Donald Trump won the state by roughly 8% (R+8),
									despite the Democrats' voter registration advantage.

								<h3>Scraping Data</h3>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/us_census.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>
									For our algorithm, we found credible sources backed up with US Census data, and scraped
									the data with Python's BeautifulSoup library. All code and sources can be found on our
									detailed report and the project repository.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Data Processing Results</h3>
								
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/csv_schema.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									After additional processing with the Pandas library, we extracted two key CSVs from the
									US Census data. Firstly, we extracted a table that stores all pairs of contiguous counties
									in Colorado. Then, we extracted a table that stores the population and PVI for each
									Colorado county.

						<h2>Societal Impacts</h2>
						<p>Here are each of our beliefs on the societal impact of our redistricting algorithm.
						</p>
						<div class="features">

								<h3>Mitch</h3>
								<p>Mitch's Opinion</p>

							<section>
								<h3>Luke</h3>
								<p>
									During the early stages of the project, when I was discussing societal questions
									with my project group, I felt that the key motive for developing an algorithmic-based
									redistricting algorithm was the lack of knowledge and trust people have for redistricting
									commissions in the present-day.<br><br>
									
									This public sentiment can be reflected and verified by recent polling. In August 2021,
									The Hill reported a poll by “the nonprofit anti-corruption group RepresentUs,” which stated
									that “[nearly] 9 in 10 voters oppose the use of redistricting in a manner that aims to help
									one political party or certain politicians win an election.” [1] So, why is there a massive
									disparity between support against gerrymandering and the gerrymandered district we see in
									our current House delegation? In my eyes, I believe that Americans are unsure what their
									alternatives for redistricting are, and if they are any better than the status quo.<br><br>
									
									This leads into one of the biggest benefits for our algorithm. It is open-source and easily
									accessible. It does not require fancy technical requirements, and can run on any
									run-of-the-mill computer. Plus, the congressional districts generated by our Markov Chain
									Monte Carlo algorithm are reproducible. It encourages people to independently evaluate
									their congressional maps.<br><br>
									
									Although different people may have different standards of fairness, the algorithm can be
									checked against the Congressional Redistricting Criteria, an official government resource
									outlining how to create ideal congressional maps. [2] For instance, a person can check if
									each political party's popular vote share matches the number of congressional districts
									won. In the 2022 House of Representatives Election in Minnesota, both parties won roughly
									50% of the popular vote and won four House seats each [3]. On the other hand, that same year 
									in Utah, the Republicans won all of the state's four House seats, despite the Democrats
									receiving roughly 33% of the statewide vote. [4] If the computer generates a map with
									districts that fail to match the statewide popular vote, they can discard the map and
									try generating a fairer one. Of course, there are other criteria people can check for,
									such as equal population, contiguity, etc.<br><br>
									
									That being said, there are valid criticisms to be made for this algorithm that can make
									people hesitant. A lack of technical knowledge behind the algorithm can make people
									skeptical, even if the algorithm produces fair congressional maps in terms of population,
									partisan lean (PVI), and other factors.<br><br>
									
									Another key criticism for our algorithm is that it does not take into account political
									trends. Take, for example, Miami-Dade county. In the 2016 US Presidential Election, the
									county voted for Hillary Clinton “by a staggering 29 percentage points in her
									presidential contest against Donald J. Trump.” Then, in the 2020 US Presidential Election,
									Biden only won Miami-Dade County by “a mere seven points,” largely due to swings in Hispanic
									voting patterns. [5]<br><br>
									
									Our algorithm can create a district that favors Democrats in 2022, but may not favor them
									in 2028, prior to the next redistricting cycle. For this reason, factoring political
									swings and trends into our model can greatly help not only the quality of the generated
									maps, but also increase public confidence in our algorithm's mission and ability to draw
									fair maps.
